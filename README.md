## How to run ImageUploader

Download the repo from [Github](https://github.com/dvampofo/ImageUploader) as a zip file. With your shell editor (e.g. Hyper or Terminal for Mac, or Cmder for Windows), type `node index.js` to run the program. When you see the message `Server has started`, in your browser type `localhost:8888` which will bring you a HTML page where you can upload your image.

## ToDo

- Improve user interface
- Allow users to upload multiple images
